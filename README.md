# Machine-Learning
#Using iris.dat and leaf.dat first i have seperated a test group.Test array has the same amount of data from each type of label.
#Then with both using manhattan and euclidian distance we have made some guesses about labeling the data.
#Then we have used the correct label data we already have to check the correctness of our guesses.
#Confusion matrix produces by using that data
